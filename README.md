# Email-spam-Detector
• Collected an email dataset from the web and conducted comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare it for analysis and modeling.

• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in spam vs. non-spam emails using seaborn and matplotlib for visual insights.

• Preprocessed text data by simplifying and converting it into numerical form (tokenization and vectorization).

• Used scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy to build and train a Logistic Regression model, achieving 90% accuracy in classifying emails as spam or not.
